## Local Configuration

`ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Local` now runs the API from local configuration only when `UseAzureAppConfig=false`. Azure App Configuration remains in use for non-local environments.

Before running locally:

1. Update `Api/appsettings.Local.json` with your local SQL connection string and any Azure AD values you need.
2. Run the API with `-p:skipNswagClientGeneration=true` if your local path contains commas.
3. Keep local settings aligned with shared dev settings to reduce environment drift.
